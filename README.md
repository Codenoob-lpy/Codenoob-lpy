Basic game rules: 
    This is a text-based adventure game and the player have to go into the infinite dungeon as deep as possible.  
    Player needs to fight with monsters which will appear in the dungeon and boss monsters will appear every ten battles. There are some special events as well. Some of them may give the player blesses/curses and some of them may give the player tasks to do.

    The current status of character will be store into another file and the program will read the directory to find whether there is any previous record or not. 

    5.Program codes in multiple files
    The functions and main program will be spearate into two files, and we will also include ascii arts in text file which will be import aswell
